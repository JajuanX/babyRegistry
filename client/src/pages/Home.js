              <p className="faqTitle">Dress code?</p>
              <br></br>
              A:  	 Yes! However, there is a special request for the Florida baby shower please see below.
              Toronto: Yellow and White.<br></br>

              Florida:  Wear ALL WHITE to the shower.<br></br>
              Women:<br></br>
              Attire:<br></br>
              Tea parties are a fun time to dress up, so embrace the chance to wear your Sunday best.  This is an all white affair.<br></br>
              Tea-length dresses typically fall midway between the knee and ankle, but just above or below the knee is also an acceptable look. Avoid very short dresses, as a tea party is not the most appropriate occasion for a miniskirt.
              A sundress is fine<br></br>

              Wear a fun hat if you want to (Optional):
              Ladies traditionally wear hats to tea parties. Hats can range from elaborate wide-brimmed sun hats to simple cloches, or you can even opt to wear a pretty fascinator or hair flower.<br></br>

              Men:<br></br>
              Attire:<br></br>
              A pair of khakis or white jeans with a white collared or polo shirt is appropriate. A blazer is optional.<br></br>

              Wear a fun hat if you want to (Optional).
              Gentlemen both traditionally wear hats to tea parties. Coordinate your hat with your outfit. A fedora looks sharp with a masculine look.<br></br>

              <p className="faqTitle">Registry?</p>
                <br></br>
              Q: Why should I use the registry?<br></br>
              A:  	A baby registry is a list of items at a specific store that the new parents would like to receive as gifts. This helps ensure that the couple receives gifts that go with their nursery decor and that they DO not receive duplicate items.<br></br>

              Q: Why did Kim and Jajuan choose Amazon?<br></br>
              A:  	You have the easy part ‚Äî simply head to the designated baby registry, and pick what you'd like to gift KJ. If they've opted into group gifting, you can go in on a gift with other friends or family members.<br></br>
              Q: Why are there two different registries?<br></br>
              A:
              If you don't have Amazon Prime, you'll have to spend at least $25 USD ($35 CAD) to be eligible for free shipping. If you have Prime, you'll get the regular, two-day free shipping rates you've come to know and love.<br></br>
              Q: Can I bring a gift outside of the registry?<br></br>
              A:  	 Yes, but we encourage our guests to order from the registry. If you would be so kind, please bring a baby book that you have signed instead of a baby shower card when giving a gift card. We accept clothes that are gender-neutral colours (i.e. grey, yellow, white, and green).<br></br>
              Q: Do I need to give the couple gift receipts?<br></br>
              A: Yes, in the event we receive duplicate items we can exchange it with you in mind.

              On what was supposed to be just a fun, celebratory engagement trip for their mutual friend in Bali, Indonesia, their love story began.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Initially meeting in China on a layover to Bali, who would‚Äôve known that their introduction would‚Äôve been the beginning of their forever journey. During the trip Kim and Jajuan spent most of their nights and days together talking and exchanging stories about life experiences, and goals that they planned to achieve. By the end of the trip they became good friends, a friendship that they wanted to continue to explore.
            </div>
            <div className="storyText">
              After the trip Kim and Jajuan remained in contact. Several weeks after, Jajuan decided to travel to Toronto, stepping out of their comfort zones, thanks to their connection and faith. After that first visit they knew it was only a matter of time. Frequent flyer miles started to accumulate because of the frequent visits between Florida and Toronto. During a visit to Florida there was a, ‚ÄúWould you be my girlfriend?‚Äù sign awaiting Kim as she walked outside to arrivals, and the rest was history.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Being far from each other is definitely a challenge, but it‚Äôs overcoming such obstacles that make their love story special, memorable and treasured. If the person is right for you, the sacrifice will be well worth it.

            <div className="storyText">
              Today, the couple is getting ready to welcome their first child KJ. Carrying a baby is the most rewarding experience a woman can enjoy, and they are excited to share this part of their journey with you.
